# RESTful Web API [HapiJS] with Node.js Framework

> This project introduces you to the fundamentals of web APIs with Node.js frameworks. Using your own private blockchain to create a web API is a huge first step toward developing your own web applications that are consumable by a variety of web clients. 


> For this project, weâ€™ll build a RESTful API using a Node.js framework that will interface with the [private blockchain!](https://github.com/KushalGH/private_blockchain_leveldb). 


## STEP 1:  SELECT Node.JS framework
- Created basic hello world using ExpressJS, SailsJS and HapiJs [Link](https://github.com/KushalGH/webservices_nodeJS)

- Reason I have selected SailsJs is:
A rich framework for building applications and services.
hapi enables developers to focus on writing reusable application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure.

## Step 2: Configure API Service (HapiJs)
- Steps to install basic "Hello World" example using HapiJs

```
$ mkdir blockchainapi

$ cd blockchainapi

$ npm init

$ npm install hapi --save

// create server.js and paste the code
$ touch server.js

$ npm start
```	

- Your URL will be up and running: http://localhost:8000/hello
